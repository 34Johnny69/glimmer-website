    <h2>Fast core</h2>

    <p>
      Glimmer is one of the fastest DOM rendering engines, delivering
      exceptional performance for initial renders as well as updates.
      Architected like a virtual machine (VM), Glimmer compiles your templates
      into low-level code so it can run as fast as possible—without sacrificing
      ease of use.

    <h2>Zero configuration</h2>

    <p>
      Don’t waste days getting your application compiling. Glimmer apps are
      built with Ember CLI, so you get a production-ready build pipeline in
      seconds. No fussy configuration files needed.

    <h2>Pedigree</h2>

    <p>
      Because Glimmer powers the components in Ember, there’s a battle-tested
      framework waiting for you when you need it. As more Glimmer features
      land in Ember, you will be able to take full advantages of Glimmer's
      optimizations.
